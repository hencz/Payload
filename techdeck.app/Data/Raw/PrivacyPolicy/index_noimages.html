            <p>Spin Master Ltd. – PRIVACY POLICY</p>
            <p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICE.  Spin Master, Ltd. (&ldquo;Spin Master&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Company&rdquo; and &ldquo;we&rdquo;) have adopted this privacy policy (&ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) to help you understand what kinds of personally identifiable information we may gather about you when you use our services, products and visit our website, (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;).  This Policy describes how we may use that information, whether we will disclose it and how you can correct that information. Please take a minute to read the following Policy so that you understand how we treat your personal information.</p>
<p>BY INSTALLING, USING, REGISTERING TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND GIVE AN EXPLICIT AND INFORMED CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL, USE, REGISTER TO OR OTHERWISE ACCESS THE SERVICES.  We reserve the right to update and modify this Policy as needed, so please review it frequently.  Your continued use of the Service after any changes signifies your acceptance to the new Policy.</p>
            <p>You should be aware that our advertisers or websites that have links on our Services may collect personally identifiable information about you. We are not responsible for the actions or policies of such websites or services and the Policy does not address the information practices of those websites or advertisers. Your use of the Services is governed by our Terms of Use and by other published rules pertaining to particular products and services offered through the Services.</p>
1.) INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br />
            <p>Personally identifiable information refers to your name, home or other address, email address, telephone number, birthday, interests or any other information that tells another person who you are when you volunteer this information.  We may request and collect such information in the course of providing services such as: (i) when you register for Services; (ii) participate in surveys, contests, special offers, give-aways, or promotions; (iii) accessing Services using a third party ID, such as social networking sites or gaming services; (iv) subscribing to newsletters; (v) purchasing a product or services through Spin Master&rsquo;s online stores; (vi) using &ldquo;tell a friend&rdquo;, &ldquo;email this page&rdquo;, or other similar features; (vii) requesting technical support. </p>
            <p>Please note: Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on message boards, in e-mails, or in chat areas on the Services, that information can be collected and used by others. If you post personal information in public places, others may send you unsolicited e-mail messages or attempt to contact you in other ways. Always be cautious about the information you provide online </p>
            2.) HOW IS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION USED?<br />
            <p>In addition to the purposes described in Section 1, we may actively collect and use email addresses and user names to track usage.  In addition, we may use an email address and user name to ban a user temporarily or permanently from the Services if that user engages in inappropriate conduct on the Services. We also may use information in the aggregate to analyze Services usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.</p>
            <p>We may disclose information where we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, or where we disclose information to service providers or other group companies who provide support for the operations of our Services and who do not use or disclose the information for any other purpose. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose in response to a law enforcement agencies or other public agency's (including schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our Services, protect the security or integrity of our Services, or enable us to take precautions against liability.</p>
            <p>If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer the information collected to a third party as part of that transaction, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
            3.) NON-PERSONAL DATA<br />
            <p>For purpose of this Policy, &ldquo;non-personal data&rdquo; means information that does not directly identify you.  Spin Master may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable Spin Master to identify you.  The types of non-personal data Spin Master may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, such as IP address, Media Access Control (&ldquo;MAC&rdquo;) address and unique device identifier or other persistent or non-persistent device identifier (&ldquo;Device ID&rdquo;); (ii) mobile phone carrier; (iii) game progress, time used playing, score and achievements; (iv) other non-personal data as reasonably required by Spin Master to enhance the Services. </p>
            4.) COOKIES<br />
            <p>We may also collect information that is stored in cookies, and we may associate this information with your personal information.  Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our Websites. We use cookies for a number of reasons.  Cookies allow you to store your session or password to avoid having to constantly re-enter your password.  Cookies also help us to tailor messages that better match your needs and interests, and they allow us to better understand how users in general use our sites, which in turn helps us to focus our resources on features that are most popular with our users.  You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your device; however, disabling cookies may affect your ability to use the Services. </p>

            6.) OPTING OUT <br />
            <p>As part of the member registration process on our Services, you may opt out of receiving periodic e-mail messages about products, companies and events by simply telling us that when you give us your personal information.
